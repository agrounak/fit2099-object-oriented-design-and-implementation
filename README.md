# fit2099-object-oriented-design-and-implementation
FIT2099 Object-oriented Design and Implementation notes, batch of Semester 1, 2019. 

## Notes
Most notes are compiled and written by me during the entire semester. It serves the purpose of providing future students more learning materials and also reference for myself in the future. Do take note of any inaccuracies made by me. 

#### PASS Exercise
Materials are obtained from PASS leader. It contains additional exercises outside lectures and tutorials to provide more hands-on learning on design principles.

## Review over FIT2099
The unit itself requires immense reading where the amount of time used to "read code" is more than "writing code". So expect to put in lots of time to read software documentation and code, as to look for the pattern (or coding style). These coding styles are called design principles and exam expects you to have the ability to code in the style where the design principle can be easily detected. Assignments are not that heavy but it requires teamwork and close collaboration. Learned some couple of skills on using local and remote repositories. My advice is to work on the assignments as early as possible as you can have the additional time to consult tutors and improve on your existing design. Exam is open-book, but in most cases do not have time to flip or refer to notes, so expect the bring-in notes to serve as a "recall" over the knowledge learnt. Focus more on reading and understanding the design rather than just "diving" directly into coding and spend more time on your own learning, rather than going to lectures (as they are not that useful). This is the key for the unit's success.

Overall Review: 8/10<br>Final Grade: HD
